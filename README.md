## Description
  
  -Motivations for this project: I wanted to learn how to use Classes in Javascript, along with Jest testing.

  -What problems this application solves: It generates a website that displays a list of employees along with their manager, with info on each employee.

  -What I learned on this project: I learned how to use classes and jest testing. I learned how classes help with the DRY method. I also leared about TDD, and how approaching coding with tests in mind will help develop more robust code.
